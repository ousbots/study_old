# Pattern Notes

## Sliding Window

These types of problems involve finding the maximum number of something with restrictions. Using
two pointers to represent the front and the back of the window that is "sliding" across the data
and keeping some information about the data seen between the two pointers is the general solution.
When the front pointer encounters a "bad" position, the back pointer is moved forward, modifying
the stored data until the front pointer is again in a good position. Usually these problems ask
about the maximum of something so keep a maximum distance seen between the pointers is the
returned solution.
